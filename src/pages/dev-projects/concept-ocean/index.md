shortDescription: "A personal website made with React and Gatsby.Js demonstrating personal projects"
---

Concept Ocean is my personal developer profile website. This site was made with Gatsby.Js; a highly optimized static site generator compatible with React.Js. Gatsby.Js is great because it allows for developers to generate quick dynamic sites without having to worry about some of the configuration requirements of a more standard Single Page Application. If you are here, you are currently testing this out. Hopefully it serves as a good demo. Please feel free to send me a line if you have any suggestions or find any bugs on your end.
