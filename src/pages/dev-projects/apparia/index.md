shortDescription: "A set of apps using Vue.Js and React.Js that connect Therapists to their patients."
---

AppAria is a Montreal based startup that I worked with in developing a set of apps aiming to connect psychologists and psychotherapists with their patients. For this, I worked on the refactoring and development of two separate apps, the first being for the therapist, and the other being for their patients. The code for these apps were initially made with React.Js, and I worked largely on the refactoring of this code-base into Vue.Js. Further than the initial refactor, I worked on different feature implementations to help push the apps forward.

Although most of my work was contained to the frontend of the apps, I gained some exposure to the inner workings of the backend of the apps as well. The application architecture for these apps entailed the coordination of six different code-bases with three back-end servers and three front-end application servers. Examining the backend code demanded the development of an understanding of Node.Js, PostgreSQL, alongside an overall understanding of backend architecture.
