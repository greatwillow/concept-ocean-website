shortDescription: "A React-Native app to allow forestry managers to log tree planting statistics"
---

Plantr Logr was my first attempt at making a larger scale app with React Native. Although the app was never finished, the project served its purpose as means for attaining some valuable learning experiences. The intention with this app was to create a central data repository for forestry managers overseeing tree-planting operations. Having been in this role in the past guided my motivation to work on this app. The overarching challenge with this app was to create an offline first experience with a front-end data management system and persistence layer.
