The Tiny Eventalizer is a small React-Native app that allows for a user to input events or tasks that may last for a duration of one day or longer.  Although my other React-Native apps had attained greater functionality, they did not have a sense of completeness yet that justified their publication and so I wanted to make something simple and complete that I could publish online.
